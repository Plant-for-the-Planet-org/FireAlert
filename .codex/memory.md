# Codex Repository Memory

## Planning Preference
- Default workflow: create a written implementation plan before coding.
- Save every approved plan in `./codex/plans/` with a descriptive file name.
- Wait for user review/approval of the plan before implementation unless the user explicitly asks to skip planning.
